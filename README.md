## Hi there! 👋

I'm **Jiyun**, a passionate developer diving into the world of data engineering. I love transforming raw data into actionable insights and exploring the latest technologies 💻

## About Me

Currently, I'm master degree student at Stevens Institute of Technology majoring in Business Intelligence&Analytics.

I believe data drives the business solutions, therefore I started to pursue a career in data analytics/engineering. The interesting fact about y bachelor degree is finance. 

I'm focused on building data analytics with solutions. I am based in the USA and continuously seeking to improve my skills and contribute to exciting projects.

I'm enthusiastic about learning and collaborating with others in the tech community.
